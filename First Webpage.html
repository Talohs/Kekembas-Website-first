			<h1 id="lane-definition"> Introduction to the roles or "lanes"</h1>
			<p class="self_portrait">Each player in league plays a specific role on their team of five players. A famous quote by the player Zig of Pro Team Pheonix One goes:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://leaguefeed.net/top-10-most-famous-league-of-legends-quotes-by-pro-players/2/"> 
				<p id="lane-definition"><i>The best thing you can do is focus your champion pool on a couple champions so you can try to figure out the most important things about the game like map awareness and when you can kill the enemy.</i></p>
			</blockquote>
				 <ul>
				  <li id="lane-definition">There is the <em>Top</em> laner, who plays obviously in top lane. 
				  <li id="lane-definition">The <em>Mid</em> lane once again playing in mid. 
				  <li id="lane-definition">The <em>Bottom</em> laner, you guessed it in the bottom lane. 
				  <li id="lane-definition">Next comes the <em>Jungler</em> whose play pattern differs significantly from the other lanes but affects all of them during the course of the game. 
				  <li id="lane-definition">Lastly is the <em>Support</em> this role generally begins in bottom lane with their co-laner. 
				</ul>
			<hr />
			<h2 id="lane-definition">The Lanes</h2>
			<p class="self_portrait">Every thirty seconds small npcs called creeps emerge from each teams base and follow a set path down the lanes towards opposing fortifications called towers. Top and bottom are a little longer than mid so tops minions arrive slightly later. Where wave management comes in is if there are an even number of creeps on either side of the lane <em>that lane</em>will push. You can also, if you have  a surplus of enemy minions on your side of the lane, prevent them from reaching your tower and thus being eliminated to restore the pushing state. This is called a <dfn>freeze</dfn>.  </p>
			<dl>
				<dt id="lanes">Top</dt><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen28.png"><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen29.png">
				<dd id="lane-definition"><em>The role of top lane is to win duels and push lanes.</em> The main method of doing this is through a simple process of wave management. By freezing waves and starving your opponent of resources you can gain an advantage over them and kill their character. This often leads to a snowballing effect where the losing side is not able to commit to a fight so they are further starved of resources leading to more deaths. The penumltimate object of Top laners is take their opponent's tower. The characters most commonly seen in this role are <def>Tanks</def>high health generally with one ability that does maximum percentile health damage, and <def>Fighters</def>medium health characters with high damage stats. </dd>
				<dt id="lanes">Mid</dt><img class="inplay2" src="Images\Screen32.png"><img class="inplay2" src="Images\Screen33.png"><br><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen34.png"><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen35.png">
				<dd id="lane-definition"><em>The role of Mid lane is to kill the enemy <def>carries</def></em>The way each carry goes about this is slightly different, but there are two broader categories they can be grouped in. The first is <def>Assassins</def> these character specialize in high mobility and spikes of damage to eliminate enemy characters. The other group <def>Mages</def> deal  damage from far away also they tend to have a <def>hard crowd control</def>ability, meaning they cause opponents to lose control of some or all of their character's actions for several seconds. </dd>
				<dt id="lanes">Bottom</dt><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen36.png"><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen41.png">
				<dd id="lane-definition"><em>The role of Bot lane is to deal damage and take turrets</em> Now you may say to yourself that sounds an awful lot like top lane. While they both deal damage and take turrets that's about where the similarities end. This role is canonically played by Marksman and a few mages but that's only under special circumstances. A  <def>Marksmen</def> uses their auto attacks, the basic move shared across all champions, to deal damage from range. They tend to have limited mobility compared to other champions but they make up for this in raw damage per second and long attacks ranges.   </dd>
				<dt id="lanes">Jungle</dt><img class="inplay2" src="Images\Screen12.png"><img class="inplay2" src="Images\Screen14.png"><br><img class="jgspecial3" src="Images\Screen22.png"><img class="jgspecial3" src="Images\Screen23.png"><img class="jgspecial3" src="Images\Screen24.png"><br><img class="jgspecial4" src="Images\Screen10.png"><img class="jgspecial4" src="Images\Screen12.png"><img class="jgspecial4" src="Images\Screen21.png"><img class="jgspecial4" src="Images\Screen25.png">
				<dd id="lane-definition"><em>The role of jungle is to secure the large objective on the left and right of the map.</em>The objectives consist of <def>Dragon or Drake</def>, a large elementally enhanced creature that provides buffs to the team that slays them. <def>Rift Herald</def>, a large creature that when defeated will walk down the lane it is summoned into and charge a turret. And <def>Baron Nashor</def>, called Baron or Nash regionally this boss monster takes multiple characters to kill and grants not only team gold but a buff that increases creep damage and toughness for your side. Junglers don't lane conventionally, they kill small neutral camps scattered over the inner portions of both sides of the map. These grant gold so the jungler isn't too far behind laners. The other job the jungle fufills is in pushing in freezes and <def>ganking</def> laners. This two vs. one approach allows a laner to get resources out of or better yet kill their opposing laner. There is an entire genre of material on the web about how and when to gank but it's beyond my scope here.</def></dd>
				<dt id="lanes">Support</dt><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen45.png"><img class="inplay" src="Images\Screen46.png">
				<dd id="lane-definition"><em>The main role of the support is to provide vision.</em> These players do not farm outright, beginning play in the bottom lane they charge an item by occasionally farming a creep to share gold with their other laner or hitting the opposing team's character with attacks or spells. Once charged to the second tier the item will allow 3 <def>wards</def>, vision granting totems that reveal an area, to be placed at a time. These wards have a timer life span that removes them from play after about two minutes. The support can restock these wards by returning to base. So why would you want this vision to be placed in the fog of war. So you can see the enemies position without them being aware you have that knowledge such as were the enemy jungler happens to be on the map.</def></dd>

			<p class="self_portrait">Why am I telling you all this? I love games! I think they are great ways to energize the mind and provide ways for people to work on complex problem solving skills. League of Legends has its failing in this catagory like any game but what it does do is improve focus and problem solving skills in a fast paced enviroment. I've always wanted to work on something like this. Maybe not the most successful computer game in the last decade, but a compelling, energizing experience that allows people to better themselves through art. <br />  </p>
			<p class="self_portrait">	So why not chess or minecraft, each of these games offers player versus player competition. Well lets take chess first, the strategy game for hundreds of years in Europe. What do League and chess have in common. They both have rote moves that players follow each game i.e a knight always moves in the same way and laners always farm cs the same way on a character. But what makes League special, at least to me over chess is the dynamic nature these rote moves have over the course of a game. How if you can seize an advantage, much like a check, and hold it: It will often prove the seed of victory. <br /> </p>
			<p class="self_portrait">So why not Minecraft then? Minecraft offers the ability to build fantastical structures and working contraptions within the block physics of the game. This has been added on to by a wave of multitudinous programmers using the simplistic game to create detailed combat and building scenarios as well as parkour. So what do these games have in common? Well at first you might think relatively little after all one is a <abbr title="Multiplayer Online Battle Arena">MOBA</abbr> and the other is a computerized lego set. Well they both test your reflexes in a consequence filled environment. Dodge that zombie or your lunch and move out of the way of the engage or lose the team fight. League of legends combines both these forms of strategic interplay and reflex testing that provide great rewards. Gumayushi's baron steals from this years worlds are a prime example of both of these concepts funneling into great play.</p>
